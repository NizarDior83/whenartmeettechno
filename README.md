# whenartmeettechno
🎨🧠 A creative lab exploring AI art generation with a focus on building and improving custom models using Stable Diffusion and LoRA.
When Art Meets Techno is a creative fusion lab exploring how AI and artistic expression can work together through generative models.The core mission: to create and continuously improve custom AI models using tools like Stable Diffusion and LoRA — powering storytelling, interactive games, and visual design.

🫠 Purpose

This project was born from a simple question:What happens when the soul of handmade art meets the logic of cutting-edge AI?

The goal is to:

Build consistent, personalized models using LoRA

Train and fine-tune characters and visual styles

Develop tools that feel more like games than generators

Empower artists and storytellers to use AI as a co-creator

🚀 Features (in progress)

✅ Stable Diffusion image generation with Hugging Face diffusers

🧪 LoRA training pipeline for consistent characters

🕹️ Game-style UI with style selection, surprise prompts, and missions

🛠️ Prompt builder and style presets

💡 Modular design for future SaaS expansion
